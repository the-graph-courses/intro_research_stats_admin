# Course Overview

This course introduces foundational concepts in statistics through the lens of public health data and practice, using the R programming language. Emphasis is placed on understanding hypothesis testing, regression methods, and interpretation of real-world data.

# Topics and Schedule

The course organized into three modules with increasing complexity.

![](images/stats_cohort_topics_schedule.png){width="523"}

Modules 1 and 2 are comprised of individual lessons (described below). Each will include:

-   A 20–30 minute interactive video

-   A code-along R script with data and practice exercises

-   Online quizzes on the TGC platform

-   Slides and lecture notes

## **Week 1: Descriptive Statistics**

**Lesson 1.1 \| Introduction to Statistics & Describing Data:** Branches of statistics, data types, and visualizing distributions with {ggplot2} in R (histograms, density curves, bar charts, box plots). (*How do we summarize and visualize data according to its variable type and distribution?*)

**Lesson 1.2 \| Measures of Central Tendency:** Calculate and interpret the mean, median, and mode of numerical variables in R. Identify skewness and assess symmetry. (*How do we summarize and visualize data according to its variable type and distribution?*)\

**Lesson 1.3 \| Measures of Dispersion & The Normal Distribution:** Calculate and interpret range, quartiles, variation, standard deviation, and z-scores in R. (*How do we quantify the spread or scattering of the data distribution?*)

## **Week 2: Inferential Statistics: Estimation**

**Lesson** **2.1 \| Sampling Distributions & The Central Limit Theorem:** Sample statistics vs population parameters, sampling variation, and CLT.\
(*How would our estimates vary upon repeated sampling?*)

**Lesson 2.2 \| Standard Error & Confidence Intervals:** Calculate and interpret standard error and confidence intervals by hand and using R.\
(*How do we quantify the spread of the sample statistic and our uncertainty in the estimated parameters?*)

## **Week 3: Inferential Statistics: Hypothesis Testing**

**Lesson 3.1 \| Understanding Statistical Significance:** P-values, alpha levels, Type I/II errors, effect size.\
(*How do we interpret p-values, confidence intervals, and the concept of "significant difference"?*)

**Lesson 3.2 \| T-tests for Comparing Means:** Independent samples, paired samples, effect sizes.\
(*Are differences in means between two groups statistically significant?*)

**Lesson 3.3 \| ANOVA for Comparing Means Across Multiple Groups:** Between-groups variance, post-hoc tests, F-statistic.\
(*Are differences in means across three or more groups, such as different treatment types, statistically significant?*)

**Lesson 3.4 \| Chi-square Tests for Categorical Variables:** Contingency tables, expected frequencies, degrees of freedom.\
(*Are differences in categorical variables, such as treatment response across demographic groups, statistically significant?*)

## **Week 4: Simple Linear Regression**

**Lesson 4.1 \| Introduction to Simple Linear Regression:** Slope, intercept, R².\
(*How do we model and predict the relationship between two continuous variables?*)

**Lesson 4.2 \| Linear Regression Assumptions & Diagnostics:** Homoscedasticity, normality, outliers.\
(*How do we check if our linear model meets requirements like linearity and normal residuals?*)

## **Week 5: Multiple Linear Regression**

**Lesson 5.1 \| Multiple Predictors & Confounding:** Partial coefficients, multicollinearity, adjusted R².\
(*How can we isolate the effect of e.g., education on spending by adjusting for age, income, and other factors?*)

**Lesson 5.2 \| Transformations in Linear Models:** Log transformations, polynomial terms.\
(*What if we need to transform skewed variables?*)

**Lesson 5.3 \| Reporting & Interpreting Linear Regression:** Coefficient tables, visualization, practical significance.\
(*How do we present coefficients, confidence intervals, and assumptions?*)

## **Week 6: Logistic Regression Basics**

**Lesson 6.1 \| Introduction to Logistic Regression & Odds Ratios:** Binary outcomes, log odds, probability.\
(*How do we model yes/no outcomes, such as COVID antibody status, and interpret odds ratios?*)

**Lesson 6.2 \| Logistic Regression Model Fit & Diagnostics:** ROC curves, sensitivity, specificity.\
(*How do we assess model quality using tools like ROC curves or classification accuracy?*)

## **Week 7: Multiple Logistic Regression**

**Lesson 7.1 \| Multiple Predictors & Confounding in Logistic Models:** Adjusted odds ratios, covariate selection, model comparison.\
(*How can we account for multiple risk factors, such as age and comorbidities, when modeling a binary outcome?*)

**Lesson 7.2 \| Reporting & Interpreting Logistic Regression:** (*How do we present logistic regression results in a paper?*)

**Lesson 7.3 \| Interactions & Special Considerations:** Effect modification, rare events.\
(*What if the effect of one predictor depends on another, or if certain events are rare?*)

## **Week 8: Count Data (Poisson & Negative Binomial Regression)**

**Lesson 8.1 \| Introduction to Count Data Models:** Rate parameters, exposure time, overdispersion.\
(*How do we model counts, e.g. number of tests/hospital visits, which often exhibit skewed distributions?*)

**Lesson 8.2 \| Evaluating and Interpreting Count Models:** Incidence rate ratios, goodness-of-fit, zero-inflation.\
(*How do we interpret and evaluate Poisson or negative binomial results?*)

## Final Project

Students will complete a comprehensive public health data analysis. This includes cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and applying appropriate regression methods. A written paper and accompanying R script are required.

# Delivery Model

## Guided cohort course (3-month live bootcamp)

### Learning Components

The live cohorts will employ a blended learning approach, combining self-paced study with interactive workshops and personalized support. The format includes:

**1) Pre-work** (6 hours per week)

![](images/clipboard-3695186804.png)

**2) Weekly Workshops** (2 hours per week)

Interactive sessions where students engage in collaborative data analysis exercises, applying pre-work content and developing new skills while interacting with peers and instructors.

**3) Help Sessions** (Two 2-hour sessions per week)

Additional support sessions where students receive personalized guidance on the course material, troubleshoot coding issues and discuss project ideas with instructors.

**4) Final Projects** (3 weeks)

Capstone projects where students apply their acquired skills to significant public health data analysis topics. These projects will be presented to peers and evaluated by instructors, as a tangible demonstration of students' competencies.
